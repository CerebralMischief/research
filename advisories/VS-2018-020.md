Pending
		
#### Vendor		
IPVanish VPN 		
		
#### Product		
IPVanish VPN for macOS

#### Product Version
3.0.11
		
#### Vulnerability Details
		
IPVanish for MacOS suffers from a root privilege escalation vulnerability.  The `com.ipvanish.osx.vpnhelper ` LaunchDaemon implements a insecure XPC service that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user.  IPVanish uses a third-party library for converting `xpc_object_t` types in to `NSObject` types for sending XPC messages. When IPVanish establishes a new connection the following XPC message is sent to the `com.ipvanish.osx.vpnhelper` LaunchDaemon. Because the XPC service itself does not validate incoming connection, this means any application installed on the operation system can send it XPC messages. In the case of the "connect" message, an attacker could manipulate the `OpenVPNPath` to point at a malicious binary on the system.  The `com.ipvanish.osx.vpnhelper` would receive the VPNHelperConnect command, then execute the malicious binary as the root user.
