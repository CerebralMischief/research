### [VS-2018-005] PrivateVPN for MacOS Root Privilege Escalation Vulnerability | XPC `path` Parameter

#### CVE ID
CVE-2018-7716

#### CVSS Score

#### Vendor
PrivateVPN

#### Product
PrivateVPN < 2.0.31

#### Vulnerability Details
PrivateVPN for MacOS suffers from a root privilege escalation vulnerability with its `com.privat.vpn.helper` privileged helper tool.  This privileged helper tool implements an XPC service that allows arbitrary installed applications to connect and send messages.  The XPC service extracts the path string from the corresponding XPC message.  This string is supposed to point to the PrivateVPN's internal **openvpn** binary.  If a new connection has not already been established, an attacker can send the XPC service a malicious XPC message with the path string pointing at a binary that he or she controls.  This results in execution of arbitrary code as the root user.

#### Vendor Response
Vendor will release update.
